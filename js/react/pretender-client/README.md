# Pretender Client

My pretender app for the challenge it's a [React App](https://reactjs.org/), the main language was javascript, with react framework. 
React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is maintained by [Facebook](https://github.com/facebook/react) and a community of individual developers and companies. React can be used as a base in the development of single-page or mobile applications. I chose react because I had some projects that created using react and it's a very practical and easy framework, I can build simple and complex apps using react. I'm using [Apollo-Client](https://www.apollographql.com/) graphql it's a client to interact with graphql server.

# Dependencies

* [Apollo-Boost](#apollo-boost)
* [Graphql-JS](#graphql-js)
* [React](#react)
* [React-Apollo](#react-apollo)
* [React-Dom](#react-dom)
* [React-Facebook-Login](#react-facebook-login)
* [React-Router-Dom](#react-router-dom)

## Apollo-Boost

[Apollo-Boost](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client/tree/master/packages/apollo-boost) the fastest, easiest way to get started with Apollo Client!
Apollo Boost is a zero-config way to start using Apollo Client. It includes some sensible defaults, such as our recommended InMemoryCache and HttpLink, which come configured for you with our recommended settings.

## Graphql-JS

[Graphql-JS](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js) the JavaScript reference implementation for GraphQL, a query language for APIs created by Facebook.

## React

[React](https://github.com/facebook/react) is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

* **Declarative:** React makes it painless to create interactive UIs. Design simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data changes. Declarative views make your code more predictable, simpler to understand, and easier to debug.
* **Component-Based:** Build encapsulated components that manage their own state, then compose them to make complex UIs. Since component logic is written in JavaScript instead of templates, you can easily pass rich data through your app and keep state out of the DOM.

## React-Apollo

[React-Apollo](https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo) allows you to fetch data from your GraphQL server and use it in building complex and reactive UIs using the React framework. React Apollo may be used in any context that React may be used. In the browser, in React Native, or in Node.js when you want to do server-side rendering.

React Apollo unlike many other tools in the React ecosystem requires no complex build setup to get up and running. As long as you have a GraphQL server you can get started building out your application with React immediately. React Apollo works out of the box with both create-react-app and React Native with a single install and with no extra hassle configuring Babel or other JavaScript tools.

## React-Dom

[React-Dom](https://github.com/facebook/react/tree/master/packages/react-dom) this package serves as the entry point of the DOM-related rendering paths. It is intended to be paired with the isomorphic React, which will be shipped as `react` to npm.

## React-Facebook-Login

[React-Facebook-Login](https://github.com/keppelen/react-facebook-login) a Component React for Facebook Login

## React-Router-Dom

[React-Router-Dom](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router/tree/master/packages/react-router-dom) DOM bindings for [React Router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router).

# Deployment

I doploy the app at Heroku the path is [Pretender-Client](https://pretender-client.herokuapp.com/).
