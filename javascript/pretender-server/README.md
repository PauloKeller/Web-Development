# Pretender Server

This is my server for the challenge it's a [Graphql](https://graphql.org/) api, the main language was javascript node and [Express](https://expressjs.com/).
Graphql is a little differente from REST api, in graphql you had only 1 endpoint, and you pass some queries that the server understand, its very similar to json but is not, graphql was created by [Facebook](https://github.com/graphql).
I'm not a pro on those graphql apis, I'm very new on this kind of tecnology but I love it, it's a challenge so it's time to try something new, and this is why I choose graphql.
